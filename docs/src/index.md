# ExprTools

ExprTools provides tooling for working with Julia expressions during [metaprogramming](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/).
This package aims to provide light-weight performant tooling without requiring additional package dependencies.

Alternatively see the [MacroTools](https://github.com/MikeInnes/MacroTools.jl) package for more powerful set of tools.
